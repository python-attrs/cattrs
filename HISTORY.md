```{currentmodule} cattrs

```

This project adheres to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/).
The first number of the version is the year.
The second number is incremented with each release, starting at 1 for each year.
The third number is for emergencies when we need to start branches for older releases.

Our backwards-compatibility policy can be found [here](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/blob/main/.github/SECURITY.md).

## 25.2.0 (unreleased)

- Add a `use_alias` parameter to {class}`cattrs.Converter`. 
  {func}`cattrs.gen.make_dict_unstructure_fn_from_attrs`, {func}`cattrs.gen.make_dict_unstructure_fn`,
  {func}`cattrs.gen.make_dict_structure_fn_from_attrs`, {func}`cattrs.gen.make_dict_structure_fn`
  and {func}`cattrs.gen.typeddicts.make_dict_structure_fn` will use the value for the `use_alias` parameter from the given converter by default now.
  If you're using these functions directly, the old behavior can be restored by passing in the desired value directly.
  ([#596](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/596) [#660](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/660))
- Fix unstructuring of generic classes with stringified annotations.
  ([#661](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/661) [#662](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/662))

## 25.1.1 (2025-06-04)

- Fixed `AttributeError: no attribute '__parameters__'` while structuring attrs classes that inherit from parametrized generic aliases from `collections.abc`.
  ([#654](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/654) [#655](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/655))

## 25.1.0 (2025-05-31)

- **Potentially breaking**: The converters raise {class}`StructureHandlerNotFoundError` more eagerly (on hook creation, instead of on hook use).
  This helps surfacing problems with missing hooks sooner.
  See [Migrations](https://catt.rs/en/latest/migrations.html#the-default-structure-hook-fallback-factory) for steps to restore legacy behavior.
  ([#577](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/577))
- Add a [Migrations](https://catt.rs/en/latest/migrations.html) page, with instructions on migrating changed behavior for each version.
  ([#577](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/577))
- [`typing.Self`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Self) is now supported in _attrs_ classes, dataclasses, TypedDicts and the dict NamedTuple factories.
  See [`typing.Self`](https://catt.rs/en/latest/defaulthooks.html#typing-self) for details.
  ([#299](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/299) [#627](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/627))
- PEP 695 type aliases can now be used with {meth}`BaseConverter.register_structure_hook` and {meth}`BaseConverter.register_unstructure_hook`.
  Previously, they required the use of {meth}`BaseConverter.register_structure_hook_func` (which is still supported).
  ([#647](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/647))
- Expose {func}`cattrs.cols.mapping_unstructure_factory` through {mod}`cattrs.cols`.
- Some `defaultdicts` are now [supported by default](https://catt.rs/en/latest/defaulthooks.html#defaultdicts), and
  {func}`cattrs.cols.is_defaultdict` and {func}`cattrs.cols.defaultdict_structure_factory` are exposed through {mod}`cattrs.cols`.
  ([#519](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/519) [#588](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/588))
- Generic PEP 695 type aliases are now supported.
  ([#611](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/611) [#618](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/618))
- The [tagged union strategy](https://catt.rs/en/stable/strategies.html#tagged-unions-strategy) now also supports type aliases of unions.
  ([#649](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/649))
- {meth}`Converter.copy` and {meth}`BaseConverter.copy` are correctly annotated as returning `Self`.
  ([#644](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/644))
- Many preconf converters (_bson_, stdlib JSON, _cbor2_, _msgpack_, _msgspec_, _orjson_, _ujson_) skip unstructuring `int` and `str` enums,
  leaving them to the underlying libraries to handle with greater efficiency.
  ([#598](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/598))
- The {class}`msgspec JSON preconf converter <cattrs.preconf.msgspec.MsgspecJsonConverter>` now handles dataclasses with private attributes more efficiently.
  ([#624](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/624))
- Literals containing enums are now unstructured properly, and their unstructuring is greatly optimized in the _bson_, stdlib JSON, _cbor2_, _msgpack_, _msgspec_, _orjson_ and _ujson_ preconf converters.
  ([#598](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/598))
- Preconf converters now handle dictionaries with literal keys properly.
  ([#599](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/599))
- Structuring TypedDicts from invalid inputs now properly raises a {class}`ClassValidationError`.
  ([#615](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/615) [#616](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/616))
- {func}`cattrs.strategies.include_subclasses` now properly works with generic parent classes.
  ([#649](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/650))
- Replace `cattrs.gen.MappingStructureFn` with {class}`cattrs.SimpleStructureHook`.
- Python 3.13 is now supported.
  ([#543](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/543) [#547](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/547))
- Python 3.8 is no longer supported, as it is end-of-life. Use previous versions on this Python version.
  ([#591](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/591))
- Change type of `Converter.__init__.unstruct_collection_overrides` from `Callable` to `Mapping[type, UnstructureHook]`
  ([#594](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/594)).
- Adopt the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (just like _attrs_).

## 24.1.3 (2025-03-25)

- Fix structuring of keyword-only dataclass fields when not using detailed validation.
  ([#637](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/637) [#638](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/638))

## 24.1.2 (2024-09-22)

- Fix {meth}`BaseConverter.register_structure_hook` and {meth}`BaseConverter.register_unstructure_hook` type hints.
  ([#581](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/581) [#582](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/582))

## 24.1.1 (2024-09-11)

- Fix {meth}`BaseConverter.register_structure_hook_factory` and {meth}`BaseConverter.register_unstructure_hook_factory` type hints.
  ([#578](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/578) [#579](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/579))

## 24.1.0 (2024-08-28)

- **Potentially breaking**: Unstructuring hooks for `typing.Any` are consistent now: values are unstructured using their runtime type.
  Previously this behavior was underspecified and inconsistent, but followed this rule in the majority of cases.
  Reverting old behavior is very dependent on the actual case; ask on the issue tracker if in doubt.
  ([#473](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/473))
- **Minor change**: Heterogeneous tuples are now unstructured into tuples instead of lists by default; this is significantly faster and widely supported by serialization libraries.
  ([#486](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/486))
- **Minor change**: {func}`cattrs.gen.make_dict_structure_fn` will use the value for the `prefer_attrib_converters` parameter from the given converter by default now.
  If you're using this function directly, the old behavior can be restored by passing in the desired values explicitly.
  ([#527](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/527) [#528](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/528))
- Introduce {meth}`BaseConverter.get_structure_hook` and {meth}`BaseConverter.get_unstructure_hook` methods.
  ([#432](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/432) [#472](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/472))
- {meth}`BaseConverter.register_structure_hook`, {meth}`BaseConverter.register_unstructure_hook`,
  {meth}`BaseConverter.register_unstructure_hook_factory` and {meth}`BaseConverter.register_structure_hook_factory`
  can now be used as decorators and have gained new features.
  See [here](https://catt.rs/en/latest/customizing.html#use-as-decorators) and [here](https://catt.rs/en/latest/customizing.html#id1) for more details.
  ([#487](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/487))
- Introduce and [document](https://catt.rs/en/latest/customizing.html#customizing-collections) the {mod}`cattrs.cols` module for better collection customizations.
  ([#504](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/504) [#540](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/540))
- Enhance the {func}`cattrs.cols.is_mapping` predicate function to also cover virtual subclasses of `abc.Mapping`.
  This enables map classes from libraries such as _immutables_ or _sortedcontainers_ to structure out-of-the-box.
  ([#555](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/555) [#556](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/556))
- Introduce the [_msgspec_](https://jcristharif.com/msgspec/) {mod}`preconf converter <cattrs.preconf.msgspec>`.
  Only JSON is supported for now, with other formats supported by _msgspec_ to come later.
  ([#481](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/481))
- The default union handler now properly takes renamed fields into account.
  ([#472](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/472))

- Add support for named tuples with type metadata ([`typing.NamedTuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple)).
  ([#425](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/425) [#491](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/491))
- Add support for optionally un/unstructuring named tuples using dictionaries.
  ([#425](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/425) [#549](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/549))
- The `include_subclasses` strategy now fetches the member hooks from the converter (making use of converter defaults) if overrides are not provided, instead of generating new hooks with no overrides.
  ([#429](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/429) [#472](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/472))
- The preconf `make_converter` factories are now correctly typed.
  ([#481](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/481))
- The {class}`orjson preconf converter <cattrs.preconf.orjson.OrjsonConverter>` now passes through dates and datetimes to orjson while unstructuring, greatly improving speed.
  ([#463](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/463))
- {mod}`cattrs.gen` generators now attach metadata to the generated functions, making them introspectable.
  ([#472](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/472))
- Structure hook factories in {mod}`cattrs.gen` now handle recursive classes better.
  ([#540](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/540))
- The [tagged union strategy](https://catt.rs/en/stable/strategies.html#tagged-unions-strategy) now leaves the tags in the payload unless `forbid_extra_keys` is set.
  ([#533](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/533) [#534](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/534))
- More robust support for `Annotated` and `NotRequired` in TypedDicts.
  ([#450](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/450))
- `typing_extensions.Literal` is now automatically structured, just like `typing.Literal`.
  ([#460](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/460) [#467](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/467))
- `typing_extensions.Any` is now supported and handled like `typing.Any`.
  ([#488](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/488) [#490](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/490))
- `Optional` types can now be consistently customized using `register_structure_hook` and `register_unstructure_hook`.

  ([#496](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/496))
- [PEP 695](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/) generics are now tested.
  ([#452](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/452))
- Imports are now sorted using Ruff.

  ([#446](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/446) [#447](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/447))

## 23.2.0 (2023-11-17)

- **Potentially breaking**: skip _attrs_ fields marked as `init=False` by default. This change is potentially breaking for unstructuring.
  See [here](https://catt.rs/en/latest/customizing.html#include_init_false) for instructions on how to restore the old behavior.
  ([#40](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/40) [#395](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/395))
- **Potentially breaking**: {py:func}`cattrs.gen.make_dict_structure_fn` and {py:func}`cattrs.gen.typeddicts.make_dict_structure_fn` will use the values for the `detailed_validation` and `forbid_extra_keys` parameters from the given converter by default now.
  If you're using these functions directly, the old behavior can be restored by passing in the desired values directly.
  ([#410](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/410) [#411](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/411))
- **Potentially breaking**: The default union structuring strategy will also use fields annotated as `typing.Literal` to help guide structuring.

  ([#405](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/405))
- The `omit` parameter of {py:func}`cattrs.override` is now of type `bool | None` (from `bool`).
  `None` is the new default and means to apply default _cattrs_ handling to the attribute, which is to omit the attribute if it's marked as `init=False`, and keep it otherwise.
- Converters can now be initialized with [custom fallback hook factories](https://catt.rs/en/latest/converters.html#fallback-hook-factories) for un/structuring.

  ([#389](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/389))
- [_attrs_ aliases](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/init.html#private-attributes-and-aliases) are now supported, although aliased fields still map to their attribute name instead of their alias by default when un/structuring.
  ([#322](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/322) [#391](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/391))

  ([#355](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/355))

## 22.2.0 (2022-10-03)

- _Potentially breaking_: `cattrs.Converter` has been renamed to `cattrs.BaseConverter`, and `cattrs.GenConverter` to `cattrs.Converter`.
  The `GenConverter` name is still available for backwards compatibility, but is deprecated.
  If you were depending on functionality specific to the old `Converter`, change your import to `from cattrs import BaseConverter`.
- [NewTypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#newtype) are now supported by the `cattrs.Converter`.
  ([#255](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/255) [#94](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/94) [#297](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/297))

  ([#253](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/253))
- Fix propagating the `detailed_validation` flag to mapping and counter structuring generators.
- Fix `typing.Set` applying too broadly when used with the `GenConverter.unstruct_collection_overrides` parameter on Python versions below 3.9. Switch to `typing.AbstractSet` on those versions to restore the old behavior.
  ([#264](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/264))
- Uncap the required Python version, to avoid problems detailed [here](https://iscinumpy.dev/post/bound-version-constraints/#pinning-the-python-version-is-special)
  ([#275](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/275))

  ([#252](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/252))
- Fix generating structuring functions for types with quotes in the name.
  ([#291](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/291) [#277](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/277))
- Fix usage of notes for the final version of [PEP 678](https://peps.python.org/pep-0678/), supported since `exceptiongroup>=1.0.0rc4`.

## 22.1.0 (2022-04-03)

- _cattrs_ now uses the CalVer versioning convention.
- _cattrs_ now has a detailed validation mode, which is enabled by default. Learn more [here](https://cattrs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validation.html).
  The old behavior can be restored by creating the converter with `detailed_validation=False`.
- _attrs_ and dataclass structuring is now ~25% faster.
- Fix an issue structuring bare `typing.List` s on Pythons lower than 3.9.
  ([#209](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/209))
- Fix structuring of non-parametrized containers like `list/dict/...` on Pythons lower than 3.9.
  ([#218](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/218))
- Fix structuring bare `typing.Tuple` on Pythons lower than 3.9.
  ([#218](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/218))
- Fix a wrong `AttributeError` of an missing `__parameters__` attribute. This could happen
  when inheriting certain generic classes – for example `typing.*` classes are affected.
  ([#217](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/217))
- Fix structuring of `enum.Enum` instances in `typing.Literal` types.
  ([#231](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/231))
- Fix unstructuring all tuples - unannotated, variable-length, homogenous and heterogenous - to `list`.
  ([#226](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/226))
- For `forbid_extra_keys` raise custom `ForbiddenExtraKeyError` instead of generic `Exception`.
  ([#225](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/225))
- All preconf converters now support `loads` and `dumps` directly. See an example [here](https://cattrs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/preconf.html).
- Fix mappings with byte keys for the orjson, bson and tomlkit converters.
  ([#241](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/241))

## 1.10.0 (2022-01-04)

```{note}
In this release, _cattrs_ introduces the {mod}`cattrs` package as the main entry point into the library, replacing the `cattr` package.

The `cattr` package is never going away, nor is it technically deprecated.
New functionality will be added only to the `cattrs` package, but there is no need to replace your current imports.

This change mirrors [a similar change in _attrs_](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/names.html).
```

- Add [PEP 563 (string annotations)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0563/) support for dataclasses.
  ([#195](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/195))
- Fix handling of dictionaries with string Enum keys for bson, orjson, and tomlkit.
- Rename the {func}`cattrs.gen.make_dict_unstructure_fn` `omit_if_default` parameter to `_cattrs_omit_if_default`, for consistency. The `omit_if_default` parameters to {class}`GenConverter` and {func}`override` are unchanged.
- Following the changes in _attrs_ 21.3.0, add a {mod}`cattrs` package mirroring the existing `cattr` package. Both package names may be used as desired, and the `cattr` package isn't going away.

## 1.9.0 (2021-12-06)

- Python 3.10 support, including support for the new union syntax (`A | B` vs `Union[A, B]`).
- The `GenConverter` can now properly structure generic classes with generic collection fields.
  ([#149](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/149))
- `omit=True` now also affects generated structuring functions.
  ([#166](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/166))
- `cattr.gen.{make_dict_structure_fn, make_dict_unstructure_fn}` now resolve type annotations automatically when PEP 563 is used.
  ([#169](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/169))
- Protocols are now unstructured as their runtime types.
  ([#177](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/177))
- Fix an issue generating structuring functions with renaming and `_cattrs_forbid_extra_keys=True`.
  ([#190](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/190))

## 1.8.0 (2021-08-13)

- Fix `GenConverter` mapping structuring for unannotated dicts on Python 3.8.
  ([#151](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/151))
- The source code for generated un/structuring functions is stored in the `linecache` cache, which enables more informative stack traces when un/structuring errors happen using the `GenConverter`. This behavior can optionally be disabled to save memory.
- Support using the attr converter callback during structure.
  By default, this is a method of last resort, but it can be elevated to the default by setting `prefer_attrib_converters=True` on `Converter` or `GenConverter`.
  ([#138](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/138))
- Fix structuring recursive classes.
  ([#159](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/159))
- Converters now support un/structuring hook factories. This is the most powerful and complex venue for customizing un/structuring. This had previously been an internal feature.
- The [Common Usage Examples](https://cattrs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#using-factory-hooks) documentation page now has a section on advanced hook factory usage.
- `cattr.override` now supports the `omit` parameter, which makes _cattrs_ skip the atribute entirely when unstructuring.
- The `cattr.preconf.bson` module is now tested against the `bson` module bundled with the `pymongo` package, because that package is much more popular than the standalone PyPI `bson` package.

## 1.7.1 (2021-05-28)

- `Literal` s are not supported on Python 3.9.0 (supported on 3.9.1 and later), so we skip importing them there.
  ([#150](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/150))

## 1.7.0 (2021-05-26)

- `cattr.global_converter` (which provides `cattr.unstructure`, `cattr.structure` etc.) is now an instance of `cattr.GenConverter`.
- `Literal` s are now supported and validated when structuring.
- Fix dependency metadata information for _attrs_.
  ([#147](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/147))
- Fix `GenConverter` mapping structuring for unannotated dicts.
  ([#148](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/148))

## 1.6.0 (2021-04-28)

- _cattrs_ now uses Poetry.
- `GenConverter` mapping structuring is now ~25% faster, and unstructuring heterogenous tuples is significantly faster.
- Add `cattr.preconf`. This package contains modules for making converters for particular serialization libraries. We currently support the standard library `json`, and third-party `ujson`, `orjson`, `msgpack`, `bson`, `pyyaml` and `tomlkit` libraries.

## 1.5.0 (2021-04-15)

- Fix an issue with `GenConverter` unstructuring _attrs_ classes and dataclasses with generic fields.
  ([#65](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/65))
- `GenConverter` has support for easy overriding of collection unstructuring types (for example, unstructure all sets to lists) through its `unstruct_collection_overrides` argument.
  ([#137](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/137))
- Unstructuring mappings with `GenConverter` is significantly faster.
- `GenConverter` supports strict handling of unexpected dictionary keys through its `forbid_extra_keys` argument.
  ([#142](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/142))

## 1.4.0 (2021-03-21)

- Fix an issue with `GenConverter` un/structuring hooks when a function hook is registered after the converter has already been used.
- Add support for `collections.abc.{Sequence, MutableSequence, Set, MutableSet}`. These should be used on 3.9+ instead of their `typing` alternatives, which are deprecated.
  ([#128](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/128))
- The `GenConverter` will unstructure iterables (`list[T]`, `tuple[T, ...]`, `set[T]`) using their type argument instead of the runtime class if its elements, if possible. These unstructuring operations are up to 40% faster.
  ([#129](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/129))
- Flesh out `Converter` and `GenConverter` initializer type annotations.
  ([#131](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/131))
- Add support for `typing.Annotated` on Python 3.9+. _cattrs_ will use the first annotation present. _cattrs_ specific annotations may be added in the future.
  ([#127](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/127))
- Add support for dataclasses.
  ([#43](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/43))

## 1.3.0 (2021-02-25)

- _cattrs_ now has a benchmark suite to help make and keep cattrs the fastest it can be. The instructions on using it can be found under the [Benchmarking](https://cattrs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmarking.html) section in the docs.
  ([#123](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/123))
- Fix an issue unstructuring tuples of non-primitives.
  ([#125](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/125))
- _cattrs_ now calls `attr.resolve_types` on _attrs_ classes when registering un/structuring hooks.
- `GenConverter` structuring and unstructuring of _attrs_ classes is significantly faster.

## 1.2.0 (2021-01-31)

- `converter.unstructure` now supports an optional parameter, `unstructure_as`, which can be used to unstructure something as a different type. Useful for unions.
- Improve support for union un/structuring hooks. Flesh out docs for advanced union handling.
  ([#115](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/115))
- Fix `GenConverter` behavior with inheritance hierarchies of _attrs_ classes.
  ([#117](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/117 [#116](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/116>))
- Refactor `GenConverter.un/structure_attrs_fromdict` into `GenConverter.gen_un/structure_attrs_fromdict` to allow calling back to `Converter.un/structure_attrs_fromdict` without sideeffects.
  ([#118](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/issues/118))

## 1.1.2 (2020-11-29)

- The default disambiguator will not consider non-required fields any more.
  ([#108](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/108))

## 1.1.0 (2020-10-29)

- Python 2, 3.5 and 3.6 support removal. If you need it, use a version below 1.1.0.
- Python 3.9 support, including support for built-in generic types (`list[int]` vs `typing.List[int]`).
- _cattrs_ now includes functions to generate specialized structuring and unstructuring hooks. Specialized hooks are faster and support overrides (`omit_if_default` and `rename`). See the `cattr.gen` module.
- _cattrs_ now includes a converter variant, `cattr.GenConverter`, that automatically generates specialized hooks for attrs classes. This converter will become the default in the future.
- Generating specialized structuring hooks now invokes [attr.resolve_types](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/api.html#attr.resolve_types) on a class if the class makes use of the new PEP 563 annotations.
- _cattrs_ now depends on _attrs_ >= 20.1.0, because of `attr.resolve_types`.
- Specialized hooks now support generic classes. The default converter will generate and use a specialized hook upon encountering a generic class.

## 1.0.0 (2019-12-27)

- Packaging fixes.
  ([#17](https://github.com/python-attrs/cattrs/pull/17))

## 0.5.0 (2017-12-11)
